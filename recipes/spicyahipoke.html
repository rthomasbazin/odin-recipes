    <h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
  </body>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound yellowfin tuna sushi/sashimi grade</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon soy sauce, to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 Tablespoon sesame oil, to taste</li>
      <li>2 finely chopped scallions</li>
      <li>1/4 onion, sliced</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons Sriracha sauce, to taste</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons tobiko</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>DIRECTIONS:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>If tuna is frozen, thaw by submerging in room temperature water for 30 minutes.</li>
      
      <li>When tuna is just short of fully thawed, slice into small cubes, around 1 inch. You could do larger or smaller, whatever you prefer. I tend to go a bit smaller for more flavor.</li>
      
      <li>Combine in a bowl with 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1/2 tbsp sesame oil, and 1 chopped scallion. I don’t really measure the soy sauce or sesame oil, but use whatever is enough to coat the tuna thinly. Chill in fridge for about 30 minutes. (See recipe below for regular shoyu poke — basically, you can stop here, but with a bit more marinade and a few optional additions.)</li>
      
      <li>Combine mayo, sriracha, remaining scallions (reserving a bit for topping), and 1 tbsp tobiko or masago, whisking briefly until combined. When tuna is chilled, add the spicy mayo and mix gently until fully coated. I just get right in there and use my hands.</li>
      
      <li>Top with a bit more tobiko and scallions, and serve! The poke will be good for up to one day, but is best eaten fresh.</li>
    </ol>
