    <p>Classic Japanese style fried chicken</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
  </body>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, chicken thighs (skin on)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons potato starch, more if necessary</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour, more if necessary</li>
      <li>4 cups neutral-flavored oil (ie: canola)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
      <li>1 clove minced garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 Tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 Tablespoon sake</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon roasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>DIRECTIONS:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
      
      <li>Cut each chicken thigh into 2-inch pieces and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
      
      <li>Grate the ginger (you will only need ½ tsp) and mince the garlic.</li>
      
      <li>In a large bowl, combine the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sake, and sesame oil. Whisk it all together.</li>
      
      <li>Add the chicken to the bowl and mix it with your hands. Cover and keep in the refrigerator to marinate for 30 minutes.</li>

      <li>Pour the oil into a heavy-bottomed pot (I used a Dutch oven) and heat it to 325ºF (163ºC) on medium heat.</li>

      <li>Meanwhile, prepare the potato starch and all-purpose flour in separate piles.</li>

      <li>First, lightly dredge each marinated chicken piece in the flour and dust off the excess flour. Then, dredge it in the potato starch and remove the excess starch.</li>

      <li>When the oil temperature has reached 325ºF (163ºC) (you’ll know it’s ready when you insert a wooden chopstick into the oil and small bubbles appear around it), gently submerge each chicken piece in the oil. Do not overcrowd the pot; add only 3-5 pieces at a time. If you put too many pieces in at once, the oil temperature will drop quickly, and the chicken will end up absorbing too much oil.</li>

      <li>First Deep-Frying: Deep-fry for 90 seconds, or until the outside of the chicken is a light golden color. If the chicken browns too quickly, then the oil temperature is too high. Either put a few more pieces of chicken in the oil or lower the heat. Controlling the oil temperature at all times is very important for deep-frying. Transfer the chicken pieces to a wire rack to drain the excess oil.</li>

      <li>The residual heat will continue to cook the chicken as it rests on the wire rack. Continue deep-frying the remaining chicken pieces. Between batches, pick up and discard the crumbs in the oil with a fine-mesh sieve. This keeps the oil clean and prevents it from becoming darker.</li>

      <li>Second Deep-Frying: Now, heat the oil to 350ºF (177ºC). Place 3 to 5 pieces of the resting chicken back into the oil and deep-fry for 45 seconds, or until the skin is golden brown and crispy. Transfer them to a wire rack to drain the excess oil. Continue with the remaining chicken pieces.</li>

      <li>Serve the chicken hot. Karaage is often served with a wedge of lemon and Japanese mayonnaise. Sprinkle shichimi togarashi for a bit of spice, if desired.</li>
