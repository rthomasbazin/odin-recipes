    <p>A mouthwatering decadent and flavorful salad using top round steak</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
  </body>
    <ul>
      <li>1 3/4 pounds top round beef</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 jalapeno pepper, divided</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon lime zest</li>
      <li>6 Tablespoons shoyu soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 sliced green onions</li>
      <li>1/2 cup olive oil, plus extra for beef</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1/3 bunch of cilantro, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cane sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1/3 cup lime juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>DIRECTIONS:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325° F.</li>
      
      <li>Trim silverskin (silvery-white connective tissue) and fat completely and cut meat into 2-inch-thick pieces, going with the grain. All pieces should be about the same size so they cook at the same rate.</li>
      
      <li>Lightly oil the beef and then lightly season with salt and pepper. Over medium-high heat, sear the meat on both sides, about 3 minutes. Transfer meat to a baking sheet and roast in oven until meat reaches an internal temperature of 130° F, about 20 minutes. Cool completely.</li>
      
      <li>Remove seeds from half of the jalapeño pepper. Combine two-thirds of the cilantro and two-thirds of the jalapeño with seeds with garlic, sugar, lime zest and red pepper flakes in a food processor and blend into a paste. Add tamari, lime juice and oil; blend until smooth. Chop the remaining cilantro and thinly slice the remaining jalapeño; set aside for garnish.</li>
      
      <li>Slice the cooled meat across the grain as thinly as possible, 2- to 3-inches long by 1/2- to 3/4-inches wide. Toss the meat in the dressing.</li>
      
      <li>Garnish with remaining jalapeño, cilantro and green onions.</li>
      
      <li>Let salad marinate for at least 1 hour before serving. Drain excess liquid and serve cold.</li>
    </ol>
